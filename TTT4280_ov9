For task 1a) we have:
The PMAG is 0.08446
The resolution for the image is 40.84967 μm
For task 1b) we have:
The PMAG is 0.13200
The resolution for the image is 83.33333 μm
The biggest practical difference between a) and b) will be the resolution quality
The resoltion for 512 pixels is 195.31250 μm
The resoltion for 256 pixels is 390.62500 μm
The resoltion for 128 pixels is 781.25000 μm
By reducing the number of pixels the resolution will deteriorate. This is because that each pixels  has a bigger area to cover when we get fewer pixels
For task 1d):
The advantages in reducing the number of active pixels for a sensor is that it´s easier to scale it down the noise.
A larger pixcel collect more "good" data than smaller pixels. If we have a small camera than we should use a high pixel count. 
We therefor have to balance the pixel size and the sensor size to get the best quality.
